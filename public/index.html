	<h1 id="title">CityDog Tracker</h1>
	<p>Live tracking of where the ferries are on the Brisbane River. Can't spot Bluey or Bingo? They've probably gone
		for a nap, and will be back soon!</p>
	<div id="map"></div>

		<p>Brisbane's main ferries are known as the <a
				href="https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/citycat-and-ferry-services">CityCats</a>
			and the little inner city ones are known as the <a
				href="https://www.brisbane.qld.gov.au/traffic-and-transport/public-transport/citycat-and-ferry-services/inner-city-ferry-services">KittyCats</a>.
			With everyone's favourite show Bluey being set primarily in Brisbane, and to celebrate Bluey's World
			opening, two of our <a href="https://www.bluey.tv/blog/brisbane-welcomes-citydogs/">CityCats have been
				transformed into CityDogs</a>. With that, I thought to whip together a quick live map of our ferries to
			make it easier to find where the CityDogs are at.
			<br /><br />
			Sometimes the CityDogs named Bluey and Bingo aren't running an active route or live tracking is temporarily
			unavailable, so they won't appear on the map.
			<br /><br />
			This map is made possible by <a
				href="https://translink.com.au/about-translink/open-data/gtfs-rt">Translink's GTFS-RT Feeds</a> and <a
				href="https://leafletjs.com/">Leaflet</a>. A little project by <a href="https://jimmyd.dev">JimmyD</a>
